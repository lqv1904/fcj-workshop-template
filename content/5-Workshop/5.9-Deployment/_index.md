### 5.9.1. Overall Architecture Review
The current system satisfies the standards of the AWS Well-Architected Framework:
* **High Availability:** Multi-AZ deployment with VPC, ALB, NAT Gateway, and RDS.
* **Security:** Private Subnets, WAF, Secrets Manager, and least-privilege IAM permissions.
* **Scalability:** Uses Serverless ECS Fargate to automatically scale based on load.

### 5.9.2. Production Environment
* The user interface is being distributed globally at ultra-high speed via the edge network (S3 + CloudFront).
* The Backend operates stably and handles thousands of concurrent requests safely behind the Application Load Balancer in the Private Subnet.
